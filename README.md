# scPCA downstream analyses

This repository is intended to store our pipeline for scPCA downstream analyses.
This pipeline has been created in a modular format with the intent for users to begin processing at the module or script that is most appropriate for their data.
This pipeline also includes an optional genes of interest analysis, when a genes of interest list is provided.

Note that R 4.1 is required for running our pipeling, along with Bioconductor 3.14.
